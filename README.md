# ZorkPeripherals
Collection of "library like" code for microcontrollers and softcores (such as RISC-V on FPGAs) and peripherals such as I2C displays, SPI flash. It is not a direct library to ensure flexibility for all kind of different architectures and to have full optimization.

There is not much here as of yet, you can find code for I2C PWM controller (PCA9685) and SPI Flash (Winbond W25Q64FV) in the branch **'work'**.

The interfaces and stubs for I2C, SPI, etc. may change in the future depending on how different devices need them.
